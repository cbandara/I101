  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6"> 
     <p>Through years of rigerous research, the group here at Team Putin have successfully created the SmartWatch&#0169;.  Research has successfully lead for us to be able to fully maximize the potential of the SmartWatch&#0169;.
        Research has helped us in determining that the wearable technology market is more than worth entering, and reasearch has worked to result in many of the features that make up the composition of
        the SmartWatch&#0169;.  The SmartWatch will function both perfectly with a smart phone and without one.  As research has shown that "For wearables to succeed beyond what they are now, they need to cut ties with our smartphones" (Boxall, 1).  The SmartWatch&#0169;
        has been created to do just that in that it works beautifully regardless of whether or not the user wishes to implement its use with his or her cell phone.  The market for wearable technology has consistently been on the rise throughout 2014.  Research has
        demonstrated that "total global wearable shipments will hit 52 million by the end of 2014" (Lamkin, 1), and impeccable number that SmartWatch&#0169; will contribute to achieving.

<DT><STRONG><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/wearables-literally-going-round-circles-wait-genres-defining-moment/">Article 1: "For Wearable Tech to Reach Nirvana, It Will Need to Find Its ‘Nevermind’"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This article provided us with thorough research into the niche market of wearable technology.  Also, from this article we were able to discern that "Tech needs to be “broad, seamless, and personal” before it will succeed" (Boxall, 1) which played a heavy influence in the work done to create SmartWatch&#0169; as a more personable device.</DD>
<DT><STRONG><a href="http://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/wareable-tech-sales-to-top-50-million-in-2014-445">Article 2: "Wearable Tech Sales to Top 50 Million by The End of The Year [2014]"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>From reasearch in sales numbers, Team Putin was able to determine that the wearable tech industry is one that is more than worth delving into innovating.  This article demonstrated that "we [should] expect connected watches - incorporating smartwatches and wireless watches - to experience extremely strong growth over the forecast period, reaching 83 million unit shipments in total by 2018" (Lamkin, 1).  This is excellent to hear as we debut SmartWatch&#0169; to the public.</DD>
<DT><STRONG><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-burrus/smart-watches-and-why-you_b_5035135.html">Article 3: "Smart Watches and Why You Might Be Wearing One Soon"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>The market for Smart Watches contains much room for growth and innovation.  The SmartWatch&#0169; has been created to branch out and reach the the most diverse audience of any similar product that has come before it's creation.  This article predicted that "As smart watches become more popular, we'll see many advances in them over the next few years, including thinner, smaller, and higher design elements" (Burrus, 1).  This prediction could not be any closer to the truth thanks to the innovations in both security and application brought about by SmartWatch&#0169;.</DD>
<DT><STRONG><a href="http://www.greenbot.com/article/2604460/my-first-48-hours-with-moto-360-the-android-wear-watch-that-gets-style-points-for-trying.html">Article 4: "My First 48 Hours With Moto 360, The Android Wear Watch That Gets Style Points for Trying"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Similar to the SmartWatch&#0169;, the Moto 360 released earlier this year to the world to mixed reviews.  Team Putin's SmartWatch&#0169 has been created to surpass the level of perfection created by the Moto 360.  As touted by reviewers, one of the key aspects of the Moto 360 was "the display is legible outdoors" (Phillips, 1), a feature that we have currated and maximized with the SmartWatch&#0169;.</DD>
<DT><STRONG><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/everykey/">Article 5: "Everykey Wants To Put Your Passwords On Your Wrist"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>One of the primary goals of the SmartWatch&#0169; is to serve as a physical encrypted authentication tool for the user.  The watch has been designed with principles of the Everykey, another password security device, in mind.  The SmartWatch&#0169; has been designed to contain the concept of the Everykey in that it "does not store any passwords itself, acting purely as an authenticator, via an encrypted signal sent over Bluetooth 4.0 when the wristband is within a customisable range to the Bluetooth device you are using" (Lomas, 1). The SmartWatch&#0169 can funtion exactly as the Everykey in that via Bluetooth technology, the user is able to authenticate that he or she is in fact the user that claims to be logging in to the device or service.</DD>
<DT><STRONG><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2688094/forget-passwords-the-nymi-wristband-uses-your-heartbeat-for-security.html">Article 6: "Forget Passwords - The Nymi Wristband Uses Your Heartbeat for Security"</a></STRONG></DT>
<DD>The Nymi is a device similar to the SmartWatch in that it serves to authenticate the user without the need for a password to be entererd following it's authentication of the user.  Experts have said that "a wearable authentication device, which communicates with devices and apps via Bluetooth, could get around that issue" (Gaudin, 1) of password protection issues that plague the world today.  Using concept similar to the Nymi, but not quite exactly the same, the SmartWatch&#0169; has been designed to function as an authenticator for the user, but it does not fully eliminate the need for a seperate password unique to the service being used to be entered.  The SmartWatch&#0169; only functions as an authenticator due to the issues and liability that would exist in the event that an individual took control of another user's device.</DD>

      <p>"My issue is that at this point in my life I have more accounts requiring password than I have creativity or a safe place to authenticate all of my created passwords.  The SmartWatch&#0169; is the perfect sollution to this issue through the fact that it will always be on my wrist.  Hopefully, this will provide me with on the fly varification."</p>

    <p>"Wearable technology today seems to be too obvious for my tastes.  What I mean is, when you look at someone who is sporting wearable technology, it is instantly obvious that they are wearing something out of the norm.  The SmartWatch&#0169; has been desgined with the appearance of "just another accessory" in mind.  I must say that this design is near-perfect in that it allows me the luxury of wearing a smart watch with the elegance of a conspicuous accessory.</p>
