     <p>In today's world, an online presence is almost a necessity to remain relevant in both the social and business aspect of life.  Typically, an individual is required to provide a password in order to access his or her personalized content by the service offered across the internet.
     	This process, of a user inputting a username and password, has been consistent on the internet from the moment of its conception.  In the modern world, a new problem is on the rise in the form of users needing to maintain multiple passwords
     	for a multitude of online services.  The issue here begins to arise when the security of a user's password is put at risk.  Previously, work had been done to create a master password which would then provide the user with access to all of his
     	or her other passwords at an instant, but this system does come with imperfections.  We here at Team Putin believe that this system of protecting a user's passwords can be improved while at the same time providing an elegant product that maintains
     	an aesthetically pleasing design.  We have created a product that will work as a physical encrypted authentication tool providing greater security in today's world of prevalent cyberhacking.  We proudly present the SmartWatch&#0169, standing at the pinnacle of watch
     	design and physical encrypted authentication tools.  Take a look around the website; we hope that you enjoy what you see.</p>

<h2>Basic Info</h2>

<p>Simply put, the SmartWatch&#0169 is the result of years of hard work and research.  We have designed a watch designed to both look sleek on the wrist of the user and function beautifully in providing the latest technology 
   available in the realm of physical encrypted authentication tools.  Password security is strengthened for the user through the application of the SmartWatch&#0169.  With the use of the SmartWatch&#0169, the user is able to simply hold
   one's phone in the hand of the watch, or even place one's wrist comfortably on the surface of one' s personal computer, to authenticate that the user is in fact tthe owner of the account that he or she wishes to access.
   The SmartWatch&#0169 is able to eliminate the need for a master password keeping application by emphasizing the fact that the easiest method of authentication is through the use of the user him or herself.
